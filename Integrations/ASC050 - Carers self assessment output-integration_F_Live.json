A carer's assessment is an opportunity for you to think about and discuss your needs as an individual. It is a chance to consider the impact your caring role has on your wellbeing and other important aspects of your life. You can fill this out yourself (this is known as a self-assessment) or you can contact the Carer's Centre if you would like to speak to someone.</p>\\n\\n<p>Portsmouth City Council will process your personal information in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. The personal details provided by you will be held on a database and where the law allows, may be shared with other departments within the council to update the details they hold about you. The council may also be required to disclose personal information to other Local Authority departments and third parties (such as the police, Audit Commission or Department for Work and Pensions) for the purposes of preventing or detecting crime, fraud or apprehending or prosecuting offenders.</p>\\n\\n<h4>Carer's details</h4>\\n\\n<h4>Carer's details:</h4>\\n\\n<div>{#carersDetails/SF_Sum}</div>\\n\\n<table class=\\\"PCCfieldsT\\\">\\n\\t<tbody>\\n\\t\\t<tr>\\n\\t\\t\\t<td>Preferred method of contact and best time of day</td>\\n\\t\\t\\t<td>{prefMethodContact}</td>\\n\\t\\t</tr>\\n\\t\\t<tr>\\n\\t\\t\\t<td>GP name:</td>\\n\\t\\t\\t<td>{GPname}</td>\\n\\t\\t</tr>\\n\\t</tbody>\\n</table>\\n\\n<h4>GP address:</h4>\\n\\n<div>{#gPAddress/SF_Sum}</div>\\n\\n<table class=\\\"PCCfieldsT\\\">\\n\\t<tbody>\\n\\t\\t<tr>\\n\\t\\t\\t<td>NHS Number</td>\\n\\t\\t\\t<td>{NHSnumber}</td>\\n\\t\\t</tr>\\n\\t\\t<tr>\\n\\t\\t\\t<td>Your relationship to the person you care for:</td>\\n\\t\\t\\t<td>{relationshipTo}</td>\\n\\t\\t</tr>\\n\\t</tbody>\\n</table>\\n\\n<h4>Details of person being cared for</h4>\\n\\n<h4>Details or person being cared for:</h4>\\n\\n<div>{#caredForPerson/SF_Sum}</div>\\n\\n<h4>Details</h4>\\n\\n<table class=\\\"PCCfieldsT\\\">\\n\\t<tbody>\\n\\t\\t<tr>\\n\\t\\t\\t<td>We may share information with other agencies to help us provide you with the right support.
